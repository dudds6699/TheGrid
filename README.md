# My Tron game
Its a basic tron game.
The project is setup in a node express application but all the relavent game related files are in the public directory.

It uses the pixi.js enginge and some sprites I cooked up.

Note that even though pixi.js has a canvas fall back i haven't tested it for that event. I purely wanted a 2d webgl renderer.
Also due to the same Same-origin policy browsers have you may have to run it in a web server.
